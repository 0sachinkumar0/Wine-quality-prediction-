### 2. Wine Quality Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the quality of red wine based on its physicochemical properties using supervised machine learning. The dataset includes features like acidity, sugar content, pH, and alcohol. After preprocessing and scaling the data, models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are trained to predict wine quality scores. The project demonstrates the use of classification algorithms to solve a real-world regression/classification problem and evaluates model performance with metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

Key Features
- Analyzes physicochemical attributes of wine
- Preprocesses and scales input features
- Implements Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers
- Assesses model performance and predicts wine quality
